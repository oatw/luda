## Introduction

Visibility utilities are class for setting the value of
the [`visiblity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility) property.
They can be used to hide or show an element without changing the layout of the element.
If you want to show an element, add the `.visible` class to it.
Oppositely, if you want to hide an element, add the `.invisible` class to it.

``` html
<div class="visible"></div>
<div class="invisible"></div>
```
